        <h1>Web Resources</h1>
        <p>These are some of the resources that I've come across that I've found helpful so far</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schoool</a><br />
            W3School is a great resource to use as an introduction to nearly
            all things needed to know in order to author good web pages.
            This is of great value because there are tons of tutorial and hands on 
            examples of many different web languages. Any one working on the web
            will find this a very handy resource to use. I can use this site as a 
            resource to help refresh my memory on various topics and help me understand 
            new topics by teaching it in a different way.<br />

            <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br />
            Stack Overflow is a website that let people of any level ask questions for help on their coding and allows for people to 
            come in and provide their take on the situation. If you have a question about a topic, 
            chances are someone has already asked it and yopu can see what somebody else said about it.
            I haven't asked a question on here yet so I don't know how fast the response time is but I can't count the 
            number of times this site saved my homework because there was already an answer to my question since somebody else asked it.
            Any one that needs help with their project can find this website helpful.<br />

            <li><p><a href="https://fontlibrary.org/">Font Library</a><br />
            Font Library is a nice little website that can help you find a font you were looking for for 
            your CSS file. It is very easy to use: just choose a font style you would like to use and just 
            copy and paste the code into your header and your CSS file and you're all good to go.
            This is very helpful for anyone who is either particular with the font style they want or
            for anyone just looking to spice up their web app.<br />

            <li><p><a href="https://pattern8.com/">pattern8</a><br />
            pattern8 is a website that provides backgrounds with cool and funky designs for free. It's all done by a 
            freelance designer based in the UK and has made this site very easy to use. The site does have a 
            limited amount of designs up to use and he is looking for other designers looking to help provide 
            more designs but the selection currently available is more than enough for a beginner like me.
            This is a great resource to find backgrounds to liven up a web application or act as a placeholder.<br />

            <li><p><a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3 Validation Service</a><br />
            W3 is a site that allows you to upload your code and check to see if there is any loose ends
            or and thing that isn't up to industry standard and tells you what you need to fix, basically checks 
            the validity of the web document. It is very easy to use and clearly marks what needs to be changed, and after 
            using it for some of my classes, it is very helpful in letting me know what the correct code is.
            For those wanting to make sure everything is up to par, this is the site to use.<br />

            <li><p><a href="https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/">JQuery Mobile Theme Roller</a><br />
            This is the JQuery Mobile theme roller. This allows you to use a standard template of a jquery mobile app and 
            allows you to customize every aspect of the design by allowing you to choose the color of each thing.
            You can change the color of the header, the links, the switches, etc. Once you are satisfied with your look,
            you can download it and add it to your code very easily. This is very ehlpful for those looking to spice up their 
            mobile app from being just plain.<br />
