        <p>My name is Khang Tran and this here is the start of my application and web development journey! 
        This is my third quarter dedicating my self to learning how to code and hopefully I can come out the 
        otherside of the tunnel with a better understanding then I did coming into it. I am very excited to 
        learn what I don't know and I am very eager to ask questions because there is a whole load of things
        that I know I don't know and this journey is all about me figuring out what I don't know and seeing if I can learn it.
        I'm not the kind of person to give up easily, especially if I am motivated and since this is still brand new for me,
        I am just excited to learn everything I can about programming.</p>
